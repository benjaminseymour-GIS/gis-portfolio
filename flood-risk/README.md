# Flood Risk Mapping – Ann Arbor, MI

This project visualizes 100-year flood zones using FEMA’s National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL). Data was imported into QGIS, styled with graduated symbology, and exported with OpenStreetMap as a base layer. This map helps identify flood-prone areas and supports disaster planning.
